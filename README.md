# OnreApp Solana Program

A Solana smart contract built with [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) that manages tokenized (re)insurance pools. The program enables the creation, management, and redemption of **ONyc tokens**, which represent fractional ownership in a regulated investment pool specializing in (re)insurance underwriting.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the program
anchor build

# Run the Rust LiteSVM integration tests
anchor build && cargo test --manifest-path programs/onreapp/Cargo.toml --tests

# Update program ID after changing keypair
anchor keys sync && anchor build
```

## Key Concepts

### Dynamic Pricing

Offers use up to 10 `OfferVector` entries with APR-based compound interest. Price grows over time using `base_price`, `apr` (scale = 6, where 10,000 = 1% and 1,000,000 = 100%), and `price_fix_duration`.

### Authority Structure

| Role               | Description                                                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `boss`             | Primary authority with full control (two-step transfer via propose/accept) |
| `admins[20]`       | Can enable the kill switch                                                 |
| `redemption_admin` | Manages redemption operations                                              |
| `approvers`        | Trusted keys for cryptographic approval verification (ed25519)             |

### Kill Switch Semantics

The kill switch is an emergency stop for guarded value-moving paths. The boss can enable or disable it; admins can only enable it.

When `state.is_killed == true`, the program rejects:

- offer execution: `take_offer`, `take_offer_v2`, `take_offer_permissionless`, `take_offer_permissionless_v2`
- Prop AMM quotes and execution: `quote_swap_buy`, `quote_swap_sell`, `open_swap_buy`, `open_swap_sell`
- redemption request movement: `create_redemption_request`, `fulfill_redemption_request`, `cancel_redemption_request`
- vault funding and recovery: `offer_vault_deposit`, `offer_vault_withdraw`, `redemption_vault_deposit`, `redemption_vault_withdraw`
- reserve/configurable vault movement: `deposit_reserve_vault`, `withdraw_reserve_vault`, `withdraw_configurable_vault`
- direct supply-changing and accrual-settling paths: `mint_to`, `burn_for_nav_increase`, `set_buffer_gross_apr`, `set_buffer_fee_config`

The kill switch does not pause every instruction. Governance and configuration-only instructions such as authority changes, admin/approver management, offer configuration, targeted disable, supply-cap configuration, and mint-authority transfer remain callable according to their normal access control.

### Token Support

Most token movement paths use the SPL Token interface and can work with **SPL Token** or **Token-2022** mints. Redemption offer/request token-in setup and market-stats recomputation for ONYC require the classic SPL Token program.

Token-2022 mints with non-zero transfer fees are rejected by guarded token-moving paths that cannot safely account for transfer-fee deltas, including offer execution, redemption operations, vault deposits/withdrawals, Prop AMM quotes/execution, BUFFER reserve movement, and configurable-vault withdrawals.

### BUFFER Yield Model

Prop AMM and BUFFER cover different high-level needs. Prop AMM is the immediate
liquidity surface for enabled ONyc markets: users can buy or sell through
automated quotes while accounting stays separate from regular offer flows.
BUFFER is the reserve-growth surface: it settles time-based reserve accrual
before ONyc supply changes and keeps reserve, management fee, and performance
fee accounting separate from redemption liquidity.

The BUFFER module stores two separate inputs for accrual:

| Field           | Source                                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `gross_apr`     | Set explicitly by `set_buffer_gross_apr`                           |
| `current_yield` | Read from the active APR on the offer supplied to the accrual path |

`state.main_offer` must be set before `mint_to` or `initialize_buffer`; both instructions validate the supplied offer against the configured address. It can be updated later with `set_main_offer`, and it must always point to an offer whose `token_out_mint` is ONyc. Runtime accrual uses the offer supplied by the executing path; `set_buffer_gross_apr` uses `state.main_offer`.

Typical on-chain BUFFER setup order:

1. create the ONyc offer
2. set `state.main_offer`
3. call `initialize_buffer`
4. call `set_buffer_gross_apr`
5. optionally call `set_buffer_fee_config`

### Constants

| Constant              | Value      |
| --------------------- | ---------- |
| `MAX_VECTORS`         | 10         |
| `MAX_ADMINS`          | 20         |
| `PRICE_DECIMALS`      | 9          |
| `MAX_ALLOWED_FEE_BPS` | 1000 (10%) |

## CLI Tool

An interactive CLI for managing deployed programs on mainnet/devnet.

```bash
# Show CLI help
pnpm cli --help

# Run a command against a specific network
pnpm cli -n mainnet-prod state get
```

### Network Environments

| Profile        | Cluster | Description             |
| -------------- | ------- | ----------------------- |
| `mainnet-prod` | Mainnet | Production program      |
| `mainnet-test` | Mainnet | Test program on mainnet |
| `mainnet-dev`  | Mainnet | Dev program on mainnet  |
| `devnet-test`  | Devnet  | Test program on devnet  |
| `devnet-dev`   | Devnet  | Dev program on devnet   |

The CLI accepts `NETWORK` or the `-n` / `--network` flag.

### Browser UI

A browser UI under `scripts/ui/` exposes the generated IDL through a configurable runtime program ID and RPC URL. It supports injected Solana wallets, account/argument forms for every IDL instruction, automatic resolution of known state fields, PDAs, and ATAs, transaction simulation, wallet signing, and base58 export for external signing workflows.

```bash
pnpm ui
```

The UI defaults to the mainnet production program ID: `onreuGhHHgVzMWSkj2oQDLDtvvGvoepBPkqyaubFcwe`. The Program ID and RPC URL are editable in the UI and persisted in browser storage. Dev mode defaults to `/rpc`, a Vite proxy to public mainnet RPC, and the proxy target can be overridden for Surfpool or private endpoints:

```bash
SURFPOOL_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8899 pnpm ui
VITE_ONRE_PROGRAM_ID=<surfpool-program-id> SURFPOOL_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8899 pnpm ui
```

The UI includes Surfpool cheatcode controls for setting `state.boss`, setting `state.redemption_admin`, and funding SOL on a fork. These controls only work against a running Surfpool RPC in the background. They call Surfpool-only RPC methods and do not work against the production mainnet program or a normal Solana RPC endpoint.

### Docker Surfpool UI

Use the Docker Surfpool environment when you want one command to start a mainnet fork, create a local upgrade authority wallet, fund it, upgrade the forked OnRe program, patch fork governance to that wallet, and serve the UI.

```bash
pnpm docker:surfpool
```

Open the UI at `http://127.0.0.1:5173`. Surfpool RPC is exposed at `http://127.0.0.1:8899`, WebSocket at `ws://127.0.0.1:8900`, and Surfpool Studio at `http://127.0.0.1:18488`.

The generated upgrade authority wallet is stored in the `surfpool-wallet` Docker volume at `/workspace/.docker-surfpool/upgrade-authority.json`. Remove the volume if you want a fresh wallet on the next run.

Optional environment overrides:

```bash
SURFPOOL_DATASOURCE_RPC_URL=https://your-mainnet-rpc.example pnpm docker:surfpool
SURFPOOL_AIRDROP_LAMPORTS=20000000000000 pnpm docker:surfpool
```

### BUFFER CLI Notes

The current CLI exposes only a subset of the on-chain BUFFER flow:

- available BUFFER commands: `buffer get`, `buffer initialize`, `buffer set-gross-yield`, `buffer set-fees`, `buffer reserve-deposit`, `buffer reserve-withdraw`, `buffer burn`
- related state/vault commands: `state set-main-offer`, `vault set-configurable-destination`, `vault withdraw-configurable`
- `buffer initialize` requires `--offer` and `--onyc-mint`
- `current_yield` is not set manually; it is derived from the active APR on the offer supplied to the accrual path

The CLI does not group the full administrative BUFFER flow under the `buffer`
namespace. Main-offer changes use `state set-main-offer`, and management or
performance fee vault withdrawals use the generic configurable-vault commands.

CLI commands that modify state can either sign locally and send, or output a base58-encoded transaction for external signing such as Squad multisig. Read-only scripts print results directly.

## Tests

Tests are Rust integration tests with **LiteSVM** for fast local testing without a validator. There is no TypeScript test suite configured in this repo; TypeScript is used for CLI and operational scripts.

The LiteSVM harness in `programs/onreapp/tests/common/svm.rs` embeds
`target/deploy/onreapp.so`, so always build before running Rust tests. Do not run
the build and test commands in parallel.

```bash
# Run all tests
anchor build && cargo test --manifest-path programs/onreapp/Cargo.toml --tests

# Run a single test file
anchor build && cargo test --manifest-path programs/onreapp/Cargo.toml --test redemption

# Run the Dockerized Rust test environment
docker compose up --build --abort-on-container-exit
```

Tests live under `programs/onreapp/tests/`. Shared LiteSVM setup and helpers are in `common/`; the instruction tests are flat Rust test files, not nested folders.

## Surfpool Regression

Surfpool regression tests assume you have already started a mainnet fork with Studio enabled. The runner only checks the existing RPC/Studio endpoints, builds the current OnRe program, patches fork governance, upgrades the forked program, funds local test balances, and runs the regression scenarios.

```bash
pnpm surfpool:regression
```

To only prepare a running Surfpool fork for manual UI usage, upgrade the program and patch fork governance without running the full regression suite:

```bash
pnpm surfpool:setup
```

Useful environment overrides:

```bash
SURFPOOL_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8899
SURFPOOL_STUDIO_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18488
SURFPOOL_REGRESSION_UPGRADE_AUTHORITY_KEYPAIR=~/.config/solana/id.json
SURFPOOL_REGRESSION_SKIP_BUILD=1
SURFPOOL_REGRESSION_SKIP_DEPLOY=1
```

## Coverage

Coverage uses the Rust LiteSVM trace flow documented in `COVERAGE.md`. It requires external tools:

```bash
cargo install sbpf-coverage
brew install lcov
```

The SBF release profile must preserve debug sections for `sbpf-coverage`.
Before running coverage, make sure the workspace `Cargo.toml` release profile is
coverage-compatible:

```toml
[profile.release]
overflow-checks = true
lto = "off"
codegen-units = 1
debug = true
strip = "none"
opt-level = 3

[profile.release.build-override]
incremental = false
codegen-units = 1
```

The `codegen-units` entries are in different profile tables. The first controls
the release program build; the `build-override` entry controls build scripts and
build-time crates. Do not use `debug = false` or `strip = "debuginfo"` for
coverage builds, because `sbpf-coverage` needs the SBF debug sections.

Run the coverage flow from the repo root:

```bash
rm -rf sbf_trace_dir coverage
cargo build-sbf --debug --tools-version v1.52 --arch v1
cp target/deploy/debug/onreapp.so target/deploy/onreapp.so
cp target/deploy/debug/onreapp.so.debug target/deploy/onreapp.so.debug
cp target/deploy/debug/onreapp.so.debug target/deploy/onreapp.debug
cargo clean -p onreapp
SBF_TRACE_DIR=$PWD/sbf_trace_dir cargo test -p onreapp --tests -- --nocapture
sbpf-coverage \
  --src-path=$PWD/programs/onreapp/src \
  --sbf-path=$PWD/target/deploy \
  --sbf-trace-dir=$PWD/sbf_trace_dir
genhtml --output-directory coverage sbf_trace_dir/*.lcov --rc branch_coverage=1
open coverage/index.html
```

Generated `sbf_trace_dir/` and `coverage/` directories are local build artifacts.
The copy step is required because debug SBF builds are emitted under
`target/deploy/debug/`, while the Rust LiteSVM tests embed
`target/deploy/onreapp.so`.
After coverage, remove the staged `target/deploy/onreapp.*` files before
building a normal release artifact.

## Cross-Chain Transfers

The `scripts/cross_chain_transfer/` directory contains CCTP v1 and v2 implementations for cross-chain USDC transfers between Ethereum and Solana.

## Updating the Program ID

```bash
cp ~/.config/solana/<keypair>.json target/deploy/onreapp-keypair.json
anchor keys sync
anchor build
```

There are no package-level `set-program:*` scripts. After copying the keypair,
run `anchor keys sync` and review the resulting `declare_id!` / Anchor metadata
diff before rebuilding.
