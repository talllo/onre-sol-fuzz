/// The main program module for the Onre App.
///
/// This module defines the entry points for all program instructions. It facilitates the creation
/// and management of offers where a "boss" provides one or two types of buy tokens in exchange for
/// sell tokens. A key feature is the dynamic pricing model for offers, where the amount of
/// sell token required can change over the offer's duration based on predefined parameters.
///
/// Core functionalities include:
/// - Making offers with dynamic pricing (`make_offer`).
/// - Taking offers with current market pricing (`take_offer`, `take_offer_permissionless`).
/// - Managing offer vectors for price control (`add_offer_vector`, `delete_offer_vector`).
/// - Program state initialization and management (`initialize`, `set_boss`, `add_admin`, `remove_admin`).
/// - Vault operations for token deposits and withdrawals (`offer_vault_deposit`, `offer_vault_withdraw`).
/// - Market information queries (`get_nav`, `get_apy`, `get_tvl`, `get_circulating_supply`).
/// - Mint authority management (`transfer_mint_authority_to_program`, `transfer_mint_authority_to_boss`).
/// - Emergency controls (`set_kill_switch`) and approval mechanisms (`set_approver`).
///
/// # Dynamic Pricing Model
/// The price for offers is determined by time-based vectors with APR (Annual Percentage Rate) growth:
/// - `base_time`: The timestamp when the vector becomes active.
/// - `base_price`: The initial price at the base_time with 9 decimal precision.
/// - `apr`: Annual percentage rate with scale=6 (e.g., 10_000 = 1%, 1_000_000 = 100%).
/// - `price_fix_duration`: Duration in seconds for each discrete pricing step.
/// The price increases over time based on the APR, calculated in discrete intervals.
///
/// # Security
/// - Access controls are enforced, for example, ensuring only the `boss` can create offers or update critical state.
/// - PDA (Program Derived Address) accounts are used for offer and token authorities, ensuring ownership.
/// - Events are emitted for significant actions (e.g., `OfferMadeOne`, `OfferTakenTwo`) for off-chain traceability.
