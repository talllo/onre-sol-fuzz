/// Deleting a vector immediately stops its price evolution and removes its configuration.

/// # Arguments
/// * `ctx` - The instruction context containing validated accounts
/// * `vector_start_time` - Start time of the pricing vector to delete
///
/// # Returns
/// * `Ok(())` - If the vector is successfully deleted
/// * `Err(crate::OnreError::VectorNotFound)` - If start_time is zero or vector doesn't exist
///
/// # Access Control
/// - Only the boss can call this instruction
/// - Boss account must match the one stored in program state
///
/// # Effects
/// - Pricing vector is set to default (empty) values
/// - Vector slot becomes available for future additions
/// - Price evolution for that timeframe is removed
///
/// # Events
/// * `OfferVectorDeletedEvent` - Emitted with offer PDA and deleted vector start time
