/// This instruction allows the boss to add an approver to one of the two available
/// approver slots. The approver is added to the first empty slot (approver1 or approver2).
/// If both slots are already filled, the instruction will fail.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `ctx` - The instruction context containing validated accounts
/// * `approver` - Public key of the account to be added as the approval authority
///
/// # Returns
/// * `Ok(())` - Successfully added approver to an empty slot
/// * `Err(crate::OnreError::BothApproversFilled)` - Both approver slots are already filled
///
/// # Access Control
/// - Only the boss can call this instruction
/// - Boss account must match the one stored in program state
///
/// # Effects
/// - Updates the program state's approver1 or approver2 field
/// - Adds an account that can provide valid approval signatures
/// - Affects all future offer operations requiring approval
