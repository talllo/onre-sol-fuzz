/// This instruction allows the boss to remove an approver by their public key.

/// # Arguments
/// * `ctx` - The instruction context containing validated accounts
/// * `approver` - Public key of the approver to remove
///
/// # Returns
/// * `Ok(())` - Successfully removed the approver
/// * `Err(crate::OnreError::NotAnApprover)` - The address is not currently an approver
///
/// # Access Control
/// - Only the boss can call this instruction
/// - Boss account must match the one stored in program state
///
/// # Effects
/// - Sets the matching approver slot (approver1 or approver2) to Pubkey::default()
/// - Removed approver can no longer provide valid approval signatures
/// - Affects all future offer operations requiring approval
