/// both boss and admins can enable it, but only the boss can disable it.

/// # Arguments
/// * `ctx` - The instruction context containing validated accounts
/// * `enable` - Whether to enable (true) or disable (false) the kill switch
///
/// # Returns
/// * `Ok(())` - If the kill switch state is successfully updated
/// * `Err(crate::OnreError::UnauthorizedToEnable)` - If non-authorized user tries to enable
/// * `Err(crate::OnreError::OnlyBossCanDisable)` - If non-boss user tries to disable
///
/// # Access Control
/// - Enable: Boss or any admin can activate the kill switch
/// - Disable: Only the boss can deactivate the kill switch
///
/// # Effects
/// - Updates the program state's is_killed field
/// - When enabled, prevents guarded execution paths, including offer execution,
///   Prop AMM quotes/swaps, redemption request create/fulfill/cancel, vault
///   deposits/withdrawals, direct mint/burn paths, and BUFFER config updates
///   that can settle accrual
/// - Governance and configuration-only instructions remain callable under their
///   normal access control
/// - Provides emergency halt capability for security incidents
